# Learnings
- Implemented basic Cypress test suite (which made fixing the last few bugs a LOT easier than without an automated test suite available)
- During this time I also transitioned my workflow to native Windows as my PC was struggling to run the VM setup done through the Odin Project

If I did this again I'd spend more time in writing a full specification and tests before starting to code - some parts of my design became overly complex near the end as I had to throw in handling for pressing operator buttons and the equals sign more than once - the tests helped here but also let my logic become more complex than it should be. 
I'd probably handle the calculations using some form of string manipulation and perhaps have a second screen handling the full calculation rather than trying to juggle everything through a single screen display.
